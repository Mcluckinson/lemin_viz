# lemin_viz

careful, has loud music

TLDR:

./vizuals -h
./vizuals "lem-in output file"
./vizuals -g "lem-in output file"

 updts: 

- found a random bus error, seems to happen at first launch, will fix some time late, for now just launch it again if it happens.

-fixed invalid resource paths that used to be configured 4 debug mode, now it works properly instead of producing resource-loading error


A playable visualizer for 21/42 lem-in project. It will draw a map, recieved as argument and show "ants" movement. -g flag will launch it in game mode. Runs on macos.
